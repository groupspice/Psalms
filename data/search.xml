        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on Psalms. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of com- mitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overempha- size one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstRarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, minis- try, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encourage- ment in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: Psalms Video Teaching DVD compan- ion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Mark Strauss. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discus- sion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passagesyou’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. 10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstThe focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstStudy NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONJesus’s disciples asked, “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1). Prayer is simply talking to God, and worship is simply bowing down before God’s majesty, so we might think we don’t need to be taught how to do these things, but we’d be wrong. Many of us feel inarticulate standing before God and trying to put our heart’s cry into words. The Psalms teach us a vocabulary of prayer and worship that we can use both in private and corporately.The Psalms were composed by various authors for a variety of purposes for both public and private life in ancient Israel. There are several kinds of psalms, and scholars use several designations for di erent types. Some psalms combine characteristics from more than one type.In this study we’ll look at four types: Psalms of Praise (session 1), Psalms of Lament (session 2), Psalms of Thanksgiving (session 3), and Royal Psalms (session 4).Psalms of praise (sometimes called hymns) celebrate who God is and his provision for life. They are often called songs of orientation because they point us toward God.The most common psalms are laments, cries to God for help. We sing lament psalms when life is di cult and disappointing. Many include desperate appeals, like “How long, Lord?” and “Why, Lord?” while others contain angry cries to God to punish the wicked that are persecuting the psalmist. These types of psalms are referred to as songs of disorientation.13]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="10">
        <text><![CDATA[IntroductionPsalms of thanksgiving are expressions of joy sung in response to God’s answer to our laments. As he faithfully provides and answers our laments, he “reorients” the psalmist’s life. Thus, these are songs of reorientation.Psalms that celebrate the human king’s role in God’s rule over his people are called royal psalms. These royal psalms often point beyond the king who was alive when they were written toward the hope for the Messiah. The Messiah or “Anointed One” is God’s  nal regent who will reign on David’s throne with justice and righ- teousness forever.There are also some types that we won’t cover in this study. For example, wisdom psalms are directed, not to God, but to other human beings to contrast godly living and the fate of the wicked. In psalms of remembrance, the singer looks at God’s great acts in history (such as the exodus from Egypt) and, through re ection on the past, gains con dence for the present and hope for the future.As we learn the purposes and heart behind these psalms, we can come away with a new, colorful, and expressive vocabulary through which we will be able to boldly approach God no matter what we face.14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEPSALMS OF PRAISE MEMORY VERSE: Let everything that has breath praise the Lord (Ps. 150:6).The song “Happy Birthday to You,” which is sung in celebration of loved ones hundreds of millions of times each year, is unarguably the most recognized song in the English language, and quite possibly in the world. Second to this is the song, “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” which honors the achievements of our colleagues and friends. These are considered songs of praise—words of adoration or celebration for someone’s accomplishments or milestones in life.Celebration through song is a very natural thing for people. When we observe national holidays or honor servicemen and women, we sing songs that commemorate our nation’s heritage. At the passage of a new year, we sing in remembrance of where we’ve been, what we’ve done, and in anticipation of what is to come.In today’s session, we will look at psalms that celebrate God—or psalms of praise that celebrate who God is and his provision for life. They are often called songs of orientation because they point us toward God.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[CONNECTING10 min.PsalmsOpen your group with prayer, asking God to put his  nger on the areas of your life that he might want to transform through the study of the Psalms of Praise.As you begin, take time to pass around a sheet of paper on which to write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Or pass around one of your study guides opened to the Small Group Roster. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this Deepening Life Together: Psalms small group study and what you expect to learn during the next few weeks.2. Share a time when you celebrated some person or situation through spoken words of praise or song. How did you feel?3. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values we’ve found most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. We recommend that you review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have room to grow in—to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.GROWING 45–50 min.Praise is genuine expression of celebration for who God is and what he does. It’s how we communicate our joy and gratitude to God for his goodness, faithfulness, and righteousness. Psalms of praise, or hymns, celebrate God through words of adoration. Most, if not all,16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Psalm 46 aloud.Psalms of Praiseof the psalms were originally written as lyrics set to music. Many praise psalms even mention singing and the playing of instruments such as the harp and trumpet. In this session we’ll look closely at two praise psalms to see what elements they contain and how they can train us to praise God more deeply.Read Psalm 8 aloud.4. Psalm 8 praises God for his grace in placing humanity in a position of authority over God’s great creation. What words or phrases does the psalmist use that indicate this is a psalm of praise?In what speci c ways does this psalm celebrate God?5. Psalm 8:1 says: “You have set your glory above the heavens.” Considering this, why can we o er praise to God over and over again and never exhaust ourselves?6. The psalmist was brought to praise as he considered the lowli- ness of humanity. Why do you think that is?Why is awe before God such an important attitude for us to cultivate?7. Psalm 8:6 tells us that the works of God’s hands have been placed under humanity’s authority. What does this mean?What responsibilities go along with this authority?8. Psalm 8:3 provides imagery that gives us insight into the psalm- ist’s activities when he wrote it. What was the author doing?What activities will foster your own spirit of praise to God for your position of authority over the many wonders of God’s creation?17]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Psalms9. Psalm 46 is a confession of fearless trust in a mighty God during a time of upheaval. Two speci c types of help are mentioned in verse 1. What are they? Describe them in your own words.10. Psalm 46:4 says: “There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God.” This river is probably a metaphor of the continuous outpouring of God’s blessings over the holy city, Jerusalem, during a time when the city was in uproar. How does this verse apply to us today?11. What does Psalm 46:8–10 say results from God’s mighty acts on behalf of his people?12. Three times in Psalm 46 we  nd the word “Selah,” which is thought to be an intentional pause for the purpose of re ec- tion. (See Study Notes.) How can intentionally placed pauses in our lives help us to remember God as our fortress in times of trouble and our source of strength to endure them?13. Praise psalms can be called psalms of orientation, because they orient us to what is really true and important. How do Psalms 18 and 46 do this?DEVELOPING 10 min.Accountability means being answerable to another for our actions. Spiritual accountability happens when we invite someone into our life for the purpose of encouraging our faith journey and challenging us in speci c areas of desired growth. Hebrews 3:12–13 says: “See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.” Opening our lives to someone and making ourselves vulnerable to their loving admonition could perhaps be one of the most di cult things to do; however, it could also result in the deepest and most lasting spiritual growth we’ve known.18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Psalms of Praise14. Scripture tells us in Ephesians 4:25: “Laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another” (NASB). One important way to discover and develop our God-given design is to partner with another Christian for spiritual connection and accountability. We call this a spiritual partnership. We strongly recommend each of you partner with someone in the group to help you in your spiritual journey during this study. This person will be your spiritual partner for the next several weeks. He or she doesn’t have to be your best friend but will simply encourage you to complete the goals you set for yourself during this study. Following through on a resolution is tough when you’re on your own, but we’ve found it makes all the di erence to have a partner cheering us on. See the Leader’s Notes for instructions for establishing spiritual partners.15. In the Appendix we’ve provided a Personal Health Plan, a chart for keeping track of your spiritual progress. You and your spiri- tual partner can use it for accountability to the goals you set for yourselves. See the Personal Health Plan for instructions. If time permits, complete the “Connect” and “Grow” questions of your Personal Health Plan and share your answers with your spiritual partner.SHARING 10 min.Each of us have people in our lives that don’t know Christ. These people make up your circles of in uence or Circles of Life. Jesus wants all of us to be instruments in bringing them closer to a rela- tionship with him.16. Use the Circles of Life diagram on the following page to help you think of people you come in contact with on a regular basis who need to be connected in Christian community. Try to write two names in each circle. Consider the following ideas for reaching out to one or two of the people you list and make a plan to follow through with them this week.19]]></text>

Which of the people on your list could you invite? It’s possible that you may need to help your friend overcome obstacles to come to a place where he or she can encounter Jesus. Does your friend need a ride to the group or help with child care?t Consider inviting a friend to attend a weekend church ser- vice with you and possibly plan to enjoy a meal together afterward. This can be a great opportunity to talk with someone about your faith in Jesus.t Is there someone who is unable to attend your group but who still needs a connection?

Oh, praise the greatness of our God! He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just.” Only our perfect God is worthy of praise.17. Focus on the words of David as you read Psalm 145 aloud together in an attitude of praise and worship.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. At the end of each session we have provided Re ections for you to begin daily time with him. There are  ve daily Scrip- ture readings with room to record your thoughts. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning and de- velop the habit of time alone with God throughout the week.19. Answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week. Close with a prayer of praise to God.Study NotesSelah: (sē ́-luh) This word is only found in the poetical books of the Old Testament. It is probably a musical notation indicating an intended pause, or interlude—a pause in the voices singing, while the instruments perform alone—though the meaning is a matter of conjecture, as there is no way to know for sure.21]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the  rst night of our group?Like all fun things in life—have a party! A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch53]]></text>

Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.54]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[LEADING FOR THE FIRST TIMELEADERSHIP 101Sweaty palms are a healthy sign. The Bible says God is gracious to the humble. Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, co-leader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.71]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Psalms of PraiseConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to take time to connect at this  rst session.2. Most of us have celebrated our loved ones’ birthdays, anniversaries, promo- tions, etc., by singing or speaking words of adoration and respect.3. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The psalmist describes God with words like “majestic” (v. 1) and names things God has done, like creating the stars and galaxies. He uses poetic images, imagining God as a craftsman using “ ngers” (v. 3) to shape the heavens, even though he’s well aware that God the Father doesn’t have literal  ngers.76LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes5. God set his glory above the heavens. Nothing beneath them can praise him adequately. There is always a sense of wonder and awe at what God has placed outside or beyond our realm.6. When wondering at the magni cence of creation, we cannot help but be reminded how small we are in the midst of such greatness. This realization of our own smallness brings us to a place of awe at the greatness of the Creator. We desperately need to cultivate awe before God, because awe helps us see things in perspective. It protects us from pride and from the foolish things we believe and do because of pride.7. The works of God’s hands include everything he created. That could mean that all of planet Earth is our playground to exploit as we like. But is that the way God expects authorities to behave? More likely, planet Earth is our responsibility to care for.8. We must remove ourselves from the busyness of life to focus on and con- template God’s creation: walk on the beach and consider the vastness of the ocean, go on a hike in the mountains, take a nature walk, look at the sky on a cloudless night.9. The two types of help identi ed in this psalm are a refuge or fortress where we can run to  nd shelter from the storm and inner strength with which we can endure our calamity.10. We are the favored people of God over whom God pours his blessings today. We take refuge in him.11. He will conquer enemy nations and restore peace and security to the nation of Israel. He will receive honor and glory.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.14. Questions 14, 15: Spiritual partners will pair up during group time and/ or through the week and use the Personal Health Plan to record plans and progress throughout our study of Psalms. For many, spiritual partners will be a new idea, but we highly encourage you to try them for this study. It’s hard to start a spiritual practice like prayer or consistent Bible reading with no support. A friend makes a huge di erence.We recommend that men partner with men and women partner with women. Partners can check in with each other weekly either during your group meetings or outside the meeting. As leader, you may want to prayer- fully decide who would be a good match with whom. Try to discern who might have good relational chemistry that may lead to a deeper connection.77]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesRemind people that this partnership isn’t forever; it’s just for a few weeks. Be sure to have extra copies of the Personal Health Plan available at this  rst meeting in case you need to have a group of three spiritual partners. It is a good idea for you to look over the Personal Health Plan before the meeting so you can help people understand how to use it.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.16. We provided a Circles of Life diagram for you and the group to use to help you identify people who need to be connected in Christian community. When people are asked why they never go to church, they often say, “No one ever invited me.” Remind the group that our responsibility is to invite people, but we are not responsible for how they respond. Talk to the group about the importance of inviting people; remind them that healthy small groups make a habit of inviting friends, neighbors, unconnected church members, co-workers, etc., to join their groups or join them at a weekend service. When people get connected to a group of new friends, they often join the church.The Circles of Life represent one of the values of the Small Group Agree- ment: “Welcome for Newcomers.” Some groups fear that newcomers will interrupt the intimacy that members have built over time. However, groups generally gain strength with the infusion of new blood. It’s like a river of living water  owing into a stagnant pond. Some groups remain permanently open, while others open periodically, such as at the beginning and ending of a study. Love grows by giving itself away. If your circle becomes too large for easy face-to-face conversations, you can simply form a second discussion circle in another room in your home.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each session will pro- vide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18. This question is meant to encourage quiet time at home each day throughout the week. Here you can help the group see the importance of making time with God a priority. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily.78]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a person’s life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the ses- sion or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two Psalms of LamentGrowing3. Psalm 3 is a prayer to God for help in the face of an enemy.4. God does not fail to answer prayer. The psalmist is con dent that God will protect him from harm and even from humiliation—which many of us fear more than physical harm.5. While many lie awake at night consumed by the worries of the day, the psalmist remains con dent in God to be his shield and deliverer, so he sleeps in peace. That sounds easy, but it isn’t. Encourage the group to talk about how they have grown in this con dence over time, or how they struggle with it. We build this con dence by turning to God and his people when we su er and experiencing how God cares for us.6.
